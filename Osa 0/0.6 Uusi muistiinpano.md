Client and server action triggered by submitting the form in a single page app https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/spa

Event handler catches the submitted text

    window.onload = function (e) {
        var form = document.getElementById("notes_form")
        form.onsubmit = function (e) {

Prevents default action with preventDefault() method (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault)

            e.preventDefault()

New date object is created as an addition for the data and they are stored in a variable called "note" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)

            var note = {
                content: e.target.elements[0].value,
                date: new Date()
            }

New "note" is pushed to the local list and the form element is emptied.

    notes.push(note)
    e.target.elements[0].value = ""

redrawNotes() function is called to redraw notes to the screen

    redrawNotes()

sendToServer() function is called to send the submitted data to the server

    sendToServer(note)

And this results in a client-server communication

    Client -> Server | HTTP POST: https://fullstack-exampleapp.herokuapp.com/new_note_spa
    Server -> Client | HTTP Response: Status 201. JSON response "{"message":"note created"}"
